# LLMR
LLMR is a simple tool to help you analyze your code with large language models. Just run the Python script in the same folder as the directory you want to target. It will:

    Combine all files in the directory (and its subfolders) into a single text file.
    Add file names as headers for easy reference.
    Count the total files processed.
    Estimate the number of tokens needed for a language model to process the text in one go.

This makes it easy to review your entire codebase with a language model.
